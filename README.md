# TailWag Dog Care Website

This is a complete, production-ready three-page website built for a dog care service (grooming, walking, boarding). It uses Tailwind CSS via CDN and follows the provided design system and capabilities. The pages are:

- index.html — Home with hero, services preview, and testimonials
- about.html — About TailWag Dog Care and team
- contact.html — Contact form to inquire or book services

Notes and conventions:
- All styling uses Tailwind CSS classes only (no external CSS blocks).
- Page content is realistic and category-appropriate for a dog care business.
- Background hero images use the placeholder syntax https://images.pexels.com/photos/8293777/pexels-photo-8293777.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940. Replace with actual images as needed.
- Font placeholders (font-[primary-font], font-[secondary-font]) indicate category-appropriate typography to be auto-processed by the build environment.
- Internal navigation links are wired for a smooth user experience.

Files:
- index.html
- about.html
- contact.html
- README.md

How to customize:
- Replace background images in the hero and service cards with real assets using the provided placeholder format: src="https://pixabay.com/get/gce117557bfafae9a19a1cb8852bbc0cdf1cf30440eebaf4b16d361c0d03032df0ea8ce2161b83481a58a688b6c63d265_640.jpg" or style="background-image: url('https://pixabay.com/get/g36ee754a2578fea36b4d02175bed3e2ed358d997bfb06969e3390b58e999a58902d2085f6de1ed7575ebc76596eefdadff40c240ed204b065b8b0b51fb833c21_640.jpg');"
